<h1> Appalachian Spring</h1>
<p> Appalachian Spring is an American ballet created by the choreographer Martha Graham and the composer Aaron Copland,<br>
    later arranged as an orchestral work. Commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge,<br>
    Copland composed the ballet music for Graham; the original choreography was by Graham,<br>
    with costumes by Edythe Gilfond and sets by Isamu Noguchi. The ballet was well received at the 1944 premiere,<br>
    earning Copland the Pulitzer Prize for Music during its 1945 United States tour. The orchestral suite <br>composed in 1945 was played that year by many symphony orchestras;<br>
    the suite is among Copland's best-known works, and the ballet remains essential in the Martha Graham Dance <br>Company repertoire.
    Graham was known for creating the "Graham technique" of dance; in the 1930s,<br>
    she began commissioning scores from various composers, often related to American history and culture.<br>
    Around the same time, Copland incorporated relatable and accessible musical characteristics of the<br> Americana style to increase his music's appeal to the general public;<br>
    he first implemented this in earlier ballets like Billy the Kid and Rodeo. The initial scenario for <br>Appalachian Spring devised by Graham was revised many times by both her and Copland;<br>
    the title characters' names were changed numerous times and other characters from the early revisions were<br> cut in the final production.
    Originally orchestrated for a thirteen-piece chamber orchestra, the score was arranged into various suites <br>by Copland for different purposes;
    the original ballet featured eight episodes,<br> three of which were cut in the well-known orchestral suite.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p> During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Aaron Copland spent much of his time promoting American composers<br> and music.[1] Copland's compositions during this time turned jazzy and dissonant,[2][3] a style that interested few.[1] During the Great Depression,<br> his left-wing political stances strengthened, motivated by addressing the concerns of ordinary people.<br>[4][1][5] This initiated the idea of music that was simple and accessible enough to be liked by the general public,<br>[1][6] a concept pioneered in his opera for children The Second Hurricane (1937) and his greatly successful ballet El Salón México (1936).<br>[1][7][8] This "ordinary music" idea is present in Appalachian Spring; Copland remarked in a 1980<br> interview that the music was "plain, singing, comparatively uncomplicated and slightly folksy.<br> Direct and approachable".[9] The composer solidified his populist and Americana style with ballets<br> like Billy the Kid (1938) and Rodeo (1942),[10][11] both of which used cowboy<br> songs and fit with the popular stereotypes about the Wild West.[11][12] In addition,<br> Lincoln Portrait (1942) and Fanfare for the Common Man (1942) received widespread acclaim for their American themes,<br> distinguishing Copland's versatility as a composer.[13]</p>
