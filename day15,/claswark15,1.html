<h1>History of Georgia (country)</h1>
<p>The nation of Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო sakartvelo) was first unified as a kingdom under the<br>
Bagrationi dynasty by the King Bagrat III of Georgia in the early 11th century, arising from a number of<br>
predecessor states of the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia. The Kingdom of Georgia flourished<br>
during the 10th to 12th centuries under King David IV the Builder and Queen Tamar the Great, and fell to<br>
the Mongol invasion by 1243, and after a brief reunion under George V the Brilliant to the Timurid Empire.<br>
By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into a number of petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the<br>
Early Modern period struggled to maintain their autonomy against Ottoman and Iranian domination until<br>
Georgia was finally annexed by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. After a brief period of<br>
independence as Democratic Republic of Georgia, the country soon ended up being a Soviet republic until<br>
the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991.<br>
The history of Georgia is inextricably linked with the history of the Georgian people.[1][2<br></p>

<h2>Prehistoric period</h2>
Evidence for the earliest occupation of the territory of present-day Georgia goes back to <br>
c. 1.8 million years ago, as evident from the excavations of Dmanisi in the south-<br>
eastern part of the country. This is the oldest evidence of humans anywhere in the world <br>
outside Africa. Later prehistoric remains (Acheulian, Mousterian and the Upper<br>
Palaeolithic) are known from numerous cave and open-air sites in Georgia. The earliest <br>
agricultural Neolithic occupation is dated sometime between 6000 and 5000 BC.[3][4][5] <br>
known as the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, where people used local obsidian for tools, <br>
raised animals such as cattle and pigs, and grew crops, including grapes.[6] <br></p>
