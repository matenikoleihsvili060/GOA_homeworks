<p>Flamingos or flamingoes[a] /fləˈmɪŋɡoʊz/ are a type of wading bird in the family Phoenicopteridae, which is<br>
    the only extant family in the order Phoenicopteriformes. There are four flamingo species distributed throughout<br>
    the Americas (including the Caribbean), and two species native to Afro-Eurasia.<br></p>
<h5>A group of flamingoes is called a "flamboyance".[2]<br></h5>
<Center><h2>Etymology</h2></center>
<p>The name flamingo comes from Portuguese or Spanish flamengo ("flame-colored"), which in turn comes from<br>
    Provençal flamenc – a combination of flama ("flame") and a Germanic-like suffix -ing. The word may also have<br>
    been influenced by the Spanish ethnonym flamenco ("Fleming" or "Flemish"). The name of the genus,<br>
    Phoenicopterus, is from the Greek φοινικόπτερος phoinikopteros, lit. 'crimson/red-feathered');[3] other genera<br>
    names include Phoeniconaias, which means "crimson/red water nymph (or naiad)", and Phoenicoparrus, which<br>
    means "crimson/red bird (though, an unknown bird of omen)".<br></p>
